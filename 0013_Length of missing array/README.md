<h1>Project  0013_Length of missing array</h1>
<h3>Difficulty: Easy </h3>
<h4>Problem's website: https://www.codewars.com</h4>   

You get an array of arrays.
If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.
But one array is missing!


You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.

Example:
[[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --> 3


If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.

When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!
There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.
